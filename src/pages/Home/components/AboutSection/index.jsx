      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Atul Gairola, a MERN stack web developer and designer from India. I
        am currently working as a Fullstack web dev intern and also taking
        freelance works ðŸ’», while pursuing my Btech in Computer Science ðŸŽ“. I
        believe in the philosophy that "one can never learn everything, but
        there is nothing one cannot learn." Thus I am passionate about
        challenging myself to learn more and create more everyday. When I am not
        developing you can find me watching anime or surfing through youtube
        falling trap to clickbaits. I like watching documentaries on space and
        wildlife and am starting to try reading as a hobby.
